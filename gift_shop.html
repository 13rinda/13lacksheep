    <h2>House Rules</h2>
      </br>
    <ul> 

      <li><strong>Last Check-in:</strong> 9:00 p.m. serves as the final check-in time, signifying that all guests must arrive before this stipulated hour. New arrivals are not permitted beyond 9:00 p.m., with potential exceptions granted solely by prior agreement with the host, Brinda. This regulation has been instituted to prevent large-scale late arrivals, which cause inconvenience to the neighboring residents.</li>
      </br>
    
      <li><strong>Guest Limit:</strong> The maximum number of guests entering the property is requested when finalizing the reservation (via the rental agreement). Any breach of this count will result in an immediate cancellation of the booking. If you have a few extra plus one's, please notify the host in advance. There is a sophisticated monitoring implemented to ensure that the maximum is not surpassed at anytime.</li>

      </br>

      <li><strong>No Moving Set-up:</strong> Do not move any of the house set up, especially the lights. If you move the sofas, or tables--move them back so we could not tell that you moved them. The cleaners charge extra for rearranging the setup, this will be deducted from your security deposit. For guidance on the initial arrangement, please consult our house pictures to ensure that the setup is meticulously maintained as it was during check-in.</li>

      </br>

    <li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Guests are required to leave the property in the same condition as they found it. We do not expect you to clean the toilet with a tooth brush--but you are expected to pick up after yourselves and do a basic cleaning. This also means no dishes in the sink.</li>

     </br>

     <li><strong>Garbage Disposal:</strong> You may not leave your garbage in our bins. You are responsible for your own garbage disposal. Garbage bags are provided for you. The city only picks up garbage once every two weeks and with bookings very often--we have received many complaints from our guests that the bins were full and there were too many bags outside the bins which was not a good look during their bookings. We had no choice but to put this rule. However, if you want us to take care of the garbage, let us know in advance and for an extra $40, we will schedule our private disposal services. Any garbage left without letting us know will affect your security deposit. We have outdoor security cameras.</li>

     </br>

      <li><strong>Open Communication</strong> I will try to reach you at the contact number(s) you have given me. I will make 2 attempts before I resort to the next measures which will be detailed in the rental agreement. It is extremely important that I am able to reach you incase of any disturbance or emergency. </li>
     
       </br>

     <li><strong>Damages:</strong> The guest who is reserving is responsible for any damages causec to the property. This includes stolen or missing items. There are before and after pictures taken by the cleaner.</li>

     </br>

      
     <li><strong>No Smoking:</strong> Smoking is not allowed inside the house. This includes vaping, shisha, marijuana, etc. Please use the back/side outdoor space to smoke.</li>
      </br>

      <li><strong>Quiet Hours:</strong> Please observe outdoor quiet hours between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM. This means no noise or disturbance will be tolerated outdoors. The neighbours govern the booking to a certain degree. If the neighbour contacts me of nuissance caused by your booking, upon the 3rd warning the booking will be cancelled immediately. </li>
     
       </br>


      <li><strong>Pets:</strong> Pets are not allowed unless prior arrangements have been made. There are additional costs associated with this service.</li>

      </br>

      <li><strong>Guest Requirements:</strong> Please share with all your guests the house rules and the rental agreement. It is important that they know the rules so that they act accordingly so that the person booking is not running around trying to maintain order during the booking. To ease the stress off of yourself--please inform your guests so that everyone can collectively contribute to maintaining peace to the neighbours and respect to the home.  </li>
     
       </br>
    

      <li><strong>Security deposit:</strong> A refundable security deposit of $100 (may varry with age) is required. We know that $100 will not protect us from all rule breaches--this is why we have a rental agreement in place. We had to take the legal route to settlements with clients in the past--so it would be the financially better decision for you to simply follow our rules. We are very understanding, please communicate with us incase of any accidents, and we will try our best to help you! Better you tell us, than we tell you ;) </li>
      

       </br>

          </br>
    

      <li><strong>Neighbourhood Peace: </strong> "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." This not only is a bible verse but it is one of the most important rules when booking with us. Do not disturb the neighbours, I know you may be tempted to introduce yourself--but they do not want to be introduced to every guest every week, simply just be mindful of them and ask your guests to use their "indoor voices" on the 'outdoots"--especially past 10pm.</li>
      

       </br>

       <li><strong>End Time:</strong> Other than the guest sleeping over (sleeping capacity of the house), your additional guests must all leave no later than 2am. Indoor music must stop at 2am. If there has been no issues during the booking--then we will not be reinforcing this rule. This means if all the rules are very carefully followed, then this rule will not apply. </li>

       </br>

        <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> There are surveillance cameras only monitoring the entrances and the outdoor surroundings of the property. Additionally, we are notified every single time the door opens and there is movement outside. When we notice too much movement outside we start camera watching religiously---so do not catch our attention by limiting the activity outside. Stay inside the house as much as possible--we say this with experience when we say--gatherings outside or group smoking sessions outside always leads to noise complaints. Please avoid this. If it is absolutely necessary to get some fresh air, please use the side or back doors--away from the mainstreet. </li>
    

      <li><strong>We Remember:</strong> We have an astonishing rate of returning customers. We remember the great bookings and show our gratitude with discounts.</li>
