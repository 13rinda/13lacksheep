              <div> In a world full of multiple bedroom houses, we choose to be different and bring you this architectural masterpiece. We chose being different. This property stands out for being oddly mesmerizing and luxurious. We prioritize customer experience and have high standards for ourselves. Black sheeps are leaders, and we aim to lead in this short term rental space. We want to set the standards...high! How will we achieve this? By providing you with utmost best experience and by catering to your needs. </div>

            </br>

            <div>As frequent Airbnb users, we have seen it all. Unaccommodating hosts, un-flexible check in and out times, strict house rules, and lack of amenities and cleanliness. However...we choose different. We are here to change up the game by delivering in the areas where most hosts lack. All we ask in return is to respect this home and the belongings. </div>

            I am the owner of 13lacksheep. I chose to open up 13lacksheep because I saw how difficult it was for me to find an event-friendly airbnb near Montreal. I was born and raised in Montreal, and I am a young professional, Software Engineer, Speech and Data Scientist at Nuance | Microsoft. In my profession we focus on developing and offering a "seamless user experience". Applying this to my 13lacksheep business, I aim to provide to my clients a one-stop, all inclusive event house, where we provide all your event needs. I want my clients to have a seamless guest experience where they can walk into this rental having their decor, cake, snacks, sound system and more already set up. Thanks to great partnerships I have established, I can source to you the best prices guaranteed. Contact me on what your event needs, I love challenges, and I am confident in my abilities to make your night a memorable, and most importantly a STRESS-FREE one!

</br></br>
              If you see that our date is booked already, ask us about our Chalet that is ~30 minutes from Montreal! I am actively looking for more properties to transform into 13lacksheep properties. Follow @13lacksheep on Instagram for updates!

            Brinda's success has inspired me to find a unique property that would provide great value to guests looking for an event-friendly and family-friendly Chalet.
